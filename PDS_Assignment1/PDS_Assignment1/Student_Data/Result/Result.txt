•	Violin Plot of Writing Scores by Lunch Type
This image makes it easier to compare writing scores to meal type. It is useful to compare the distribution of writing scores between students who receive free or reduced-price lunches and those who do not. This helps discover potential differences in writing performance related to lunch type, which might be important for determining the need for academic support.

This heatmap makes it easier to analyze the relationships between several scores (math, reading, and writing). It shows how closely these scores are related visually. High positive correlations reflect a strong positive association between scores, whereas negative correlations indicate an adverse relationship. This makes it easier to identify the subjects that are more connected, which may help with curriculum changes or focused treatments.
